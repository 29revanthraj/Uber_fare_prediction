# Uber_fare_prediction
Uber, Ola, Meru Cabs, and other cab businesses have pop up in recent years. And these taxi firms serve tens of thousands of people every day. As a result, it becomes critical to precisely predict the fares. 
Uber is one of the popular cab service.
This paper is about a uber cab fare prediction system which will be more useful for the user.
The motive of this paper is to compare all the fare details of specified cabs and predict the lowest fare cab using linear regression method.
The proposed system helps to predict the fare of uber cabs using linear regression.  (which contains labelled data). 
Now we train our model with the previous dataset and then test the model with new data values and predict the fare 
This application can improve the transport accessibility, reduce waiting time and reduce the transportation fare etc.
